#You run inside the garden, slide in the bushes, catch your breath while you can and try to make as little noise as possible.

While crouched in the bushes you notice a blink in a corner of your eye. Looks like a key that would fit in the staircase door's lock.
They probably HAVE locked the door and tried to hide the key here so you don't steal it from them and run away.

What's unlucky though is one of them stops near the door to check if you, perhaps, are trying to fool them.

#Options
#[1] - Take off running. He may not expect the boldness and not be able to catch you
[2] - Try to fight him. Debatable option
[3] - Throw something to distract him and move past him to the door you just found a key for.
