#You hear footsteps coming from the hallway. 

You know you closed all of the windows but you know it wouldn't stop them

You don't know who they are but you know why they're here.

You decide not to wait for them to find you. You grab your backpack and jump out of the apartment door into the corridor.

They totally heard this and you know they're already behind you.

There's a door to the staircase you can use to get to the bottom floor but 
they surely thought about it and probably locked the door.

There's also a door that usually isn't locked a couple big steps away from you that leads to the roof garden 
you could probably try to hide in

Also there's a window but you're not that brave... are you?

#Options
#[1] - Abruptly stop around the corner and hide in the inside garden
[2] - Jump out the window onto the neighbouring roof
[3] - Try your luck with the staircase door
